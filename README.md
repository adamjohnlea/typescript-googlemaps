# Typescript Google Maps Implementation

## Synopsis
I'm learning typescript, this is the initial project i have chosen to work on.

It's very simple, some random user and company information are generated by Faker:

User:
<ul>
<li>name</li>
location:
    latitude, longitude
</ul>

Company:
<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>catchphrase</li>
location:
    latitude, longitude
</ul>

The code adds a marker at the specified location and when the marker is clicked an InfoWindow is displayed showing info appropriate for the chosen User or Company.
